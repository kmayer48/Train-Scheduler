# Train-Scheduler

## The DC Metro times app is a train scheduler tht works with Moment.js to show what time the next train will arrived based off of the Frequency and start time.

## To add a new train at the bottom, input the train name, destination, frist train time, and the frequency. The logic will take care of the rest!

### The app integrates with Firebase to store and all trains entered and keeps a running record on a live database.
